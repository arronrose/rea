# Recursive Enumeration Algorithm

This is a Python implementation of V. M. Jiménez & A. Marzal’s **Recursive Enumeration Algorithm** for computing the **k shortest paths** between two nodes of a graph.

It is intended for educational purposes, i.e., understanding the algorithm, – not production use of any kind.
Please use a debugger to step through the algorithm and inspect the data structures.

## Todo

* [ ] write some explanatory documentation (especially regarding the data structures and `tail_k`)
